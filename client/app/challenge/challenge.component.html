            In this kata your task is to differentiate a mathematical expression given as a string in prefix notation. The result should
            be the derivative of the expression returned in prefix notation. To simplify things we will use a simple list
            format made up of parentesis and spaces. The expression format is (func arg1) or (op arg1 arg2) where op means
            operator, func means function and arg1, arg2 are aguments to the operator or function. For example (+ x 1) or
            (cos x) The expressions will always have balanced parentesis and with spaces between list items. Expression operators,
            functions and arguments will all be lowercase. Expressions are single variable expressions using x as the variable.
            Expressions can have nested arguments at any depth for example
            <code>(+ (* 1 x) (* 2 (+ x 1)))</code> Examples of prefix notation in this format:
            <pre><code data-language="javascript">
            (+ x 2) // prefix notation version of x+2
            (* (+ x 3) 5)  // same as 5 * (x + 3) 
            (cos (+ x 1))  // same as cos(x+1) 
            (^ x 2)        // same as x^2 meaning x raised to power of 2</code></pre> The operators and functions you are required to implement are
            <code>+ - * / ^ cos sin tan exp ln</code> where
            <code>^</code> means raised to power of.
            <code>exp</code> is the exponential function (same as e^x) and
            <code>ln</code> is the natural logarithm (base e). Example of input values and their derivatives:
            <pre><code data-language="javascript">
              (* 1 x) => 1
              (^ x 3) => (* 3 (^ x 2))
              (cos x) => (* (sin x) -1)
          </code></pre> In addition to returning the derivative your solution must also do some simplifications of the result but only
            what is specified below.
            <br/>
            <ul>
              <li>The returned expression should not have unecessary 0 or 1 factors. For example it should not return (* 1 (+
                x 1)) but simply the term (+ x 1) similarly it should not return (* 0 (+ x 1)) instead it should return just
                0
              </li>
              <li>Results with two constant values such as for example (+ 2 2) should be evaluated and returned as a single value
                4.
              </li>
              <li>Any argument raised to the zero power should return 1 and if raised to 1 should return the same value or variable.
                For example (^ x 0) should return 1 and (^ x 1) should return x</li>
            </ul>
            Think recursively and build your answer according to the rules of derivation.

            One man (lets call him Eulampy) has a collection of some almost identical Faberg√® eggs. One day his friend Tempter said to

              <li>Do you see that skyscraper? And can you tell me a maximal floor that if you drop your egg from will not crack

                But if you give me N eggs, - says Tempter - I'l tell you an answer.</li>
              <li>
                Deal - said Eulampy. But I have one requirement before we start this: if I will see more than M falls of egg, my heart will
                be crushed instead of egg. So you have only M trys to throw eggs. Would you tell me an exact floor with this
                limitation?

            In the nation of CodeWars, there lives an Elder who has lived for a long time. Some people call him the Grandpatriarch, but
            most people just refer to him as the Elder.
            <br/> There is a secret to his longetivity: he has a lot of young worshippers, who regularly perform a ritual to ensure
            that the Elder stays immortal:
            <ul>
              <li>The worshippers lines up in a magic rectangle, of dimensions m and n.
              </li>
              <li>They channel their will to wish for the Elder. In this magic rectangle, any worshipper can donate time equal
                to the xor of the column and the row (zero-indexed) he's on, in seconds, to the Elder.</li>
              <li>
                However, not every ritual goes perfectly. The donation of time from the worshippers to the Elder will experience a transmission
                loss l (in seconds). Also, if a specific worshipper cannot channel more than l seconds, the Elder will not
                be able to receive this worshipper's donation.</li>
            </ul>
            The estimated age of the Elder is so old it's probably bigger than the total number of atoms in the universe. However, the
            lazy programmers (who made a big news by inventing the Y2K bug and other related things) apparently didn't think
            thoroughly enough about this, and so their simple date-time system can only record time from 0 to t-1 seconds.
            If the elder received the total amount of time (in seconds) more than the system can store, it will be wrapped
            around so that the time would be between the range 0 to t-1.
            <br/> Given m, n, l and t, please find the number of seconds the Elder has received, represented in the poor programmer's
            date-time system.
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <pre><code data-language="javascript">
                m=8, n=5, l=1, t=100

                Let's draw out the whole magic rectangle:
                0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                1 0 3 2 5 4 7 6
                2 3 0 1 6 7 4 5
                3 2 1 0 7 6 5 4
                4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3
                
                Applying a transmission loss of 1:
                0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
                0 0 2 1 4 3 6 5
                1 2 0 0 5 6 3 4
                2 1 0 0 6 5 4 3
                3 4 5 6 0 0 1 2
                
                Adding up all the time gives 105 seconds.
                
                Because the system can only store time between 0 to 99 seconds, 
                the first 100 seconds of time will be lost, giving the answer of 5.
                
            </code></pre> Clues are passed in as an Array(28) of
            <br/> This is no ordinary magic (the Elder's life is at stake), so you need to care about performance. All test cases
            (900 tests) can be passed within 1 second, but naive solutions will time out easily. Good luck, and do not displease
            the Elder.
